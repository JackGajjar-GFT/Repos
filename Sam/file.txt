To get to the point of pull into DevOps I must
    git rebase master                               -Pull changes into my branch
    git add .
    git commit -am "Adds Sams folder and file"      -Commits my change to my local repo
    git push                                        -Push my change to my branch in ADO

Then I must return to the ADO and submit a pull request
